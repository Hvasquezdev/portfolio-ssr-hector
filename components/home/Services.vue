        I'm Hector Vasquez, and this is a short history of how I ended up loving
        to code.
        <br /><br />
        It all started when I was 15 years old. I was a video games lover and
        then some day I was thinking â€œHow are these things made?â€œ. I started to
        search for an answer and that's when I arrived at a video tutorial of
        C++. The first time was a bit scary to see all those strange words ðŸ˜…
        but with time I started to see that I liked to do this. Since then I
        can't get enough. I learned a few things about gameplay programming and
        then started in Front-end development, I love both of those worlds and
        right now I could say that Front-end is what I love to do the most.
        <br /><br />
        I love all the things related to Front-end, making websites responsive
        and then watch those websites in my phone or desktop screen and see how
        they work and look is amazing.
        <br /><br />
        I started in the professional world as a freelancer by collaborating
        with some people and companies. Then I started to work for some startups
        as a Front-end developer, some times as the only Front-end developer and
        some times as a member of small teams with great people. I am currently
        working for a <strong>YC start-up</strong> as a front-end developer.
        <br /><br />
        My technical strengths are based on front-end development with modern
        JavaScript. They include responsive design and mobile first, design
        patterns, problem solving, web optimization like SEO, performance and
        accessibility. I consider myself a quick learner and love playing around
        3D web with Three.js, still learning and playing a lot with it.
        <br /><br />
        I speak <strong>Spanish</strong> as a native language and
        <strong>English</strong> at an intermediate level.
